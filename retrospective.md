# Final Project Retrospective

## Team Members
- Student 1: Adrian Garett Sian
- Student 2: Ethan Joshua Camingao

## 1. How did you divide the work between you and your partner?
_(Who worked on which features? How was the work assigned or negotiated?)_
Garett: We divided the work into two parts. Ethan was assigned to do the login and filtering of product while I was assigned to do the product creation and displaying of products. 
The work was assigned on which we prefer comfortable doing in this part of the project.

## 2. What Git strategies or commands helped you most during the project?
_(E.g., branching, rebasing, frequent commits, etc.)_
Garett: The commands that I used most frequently are 'add' and 'commit'. I use these often because each commit represents a new feature. I avoid compiling all the changes into a single commit because it is more difficult to identify and revert specific errors when they are grouped together in one large commit. I also use the 'pull --no-rebase' command, as it is the proper way to pull changes from GitHub and it clearly shows any merge conflicts. Lastly, the command I use the least is 'push'. I usually compile all the commits and push them only after I am done coding.

## 3. Describe a merge conflict you encountered. What caused it and how did you resolve it?
_(Include any lessons learned or techniques used to resolve the issue.)_
Garett: We encountered a merge conflict in the product_model file. Ethan named the variable product_List, while I named it item_list. When I requested a PR, GitHub reported the conflict. We decided to keep the original name, product_list, as it aligns better with the file name, product_model.

## 4. What were the biggest challenges you faced as a team?
_(This can include communication, Git usage, or coordination.)_
Garett: The biggest challenge we faced as a pair was causing a merge conflict. Since we were synchronized in the tasks given, we did not encounter a merge conflict initially. The conflict happened after we attempted to figure out the product_model file and brainstormed ways to improve the variable names in that file.

## 5. What did you learn about using Git in a collaborative setting?
_(Any insights or habits you’d apply in future projects?)_
Garett: I learned that using Git in a collaborative setting requires not just technical knowledge, but also communication and coordination. Branching and pull requests help keep individual work separate while allowing for smooth integration. I also realized how important it is to write clear commit messages, resolve merge conflicts carefully, and follow a shared workflow. Most importantly, Git makes teamwork more efficient and traceable, especially when everyone aligns on best practices.

## 6. How would you improve your workflow next time?
_(Think about technical habits and teamwork practices.)_
Garett: Next time, I would improve my workflow by setting up clearer task breakdowns including the names of the functions early on and aligning better with the team on priorities that needs to be finished. I’ve realized the value of consistently using tools like Git issues, branches, and pull requests with proper labels and documentation. I’d also allocate more time for code reviews and automated testing to catch issues earlier.

## 7. Optional: Any feedback on the activity?
_(What worked well? What was confusing or could be improved?)_
Garett: The activity was well-structured and gave a clear understanding of how product features are broken down and translated into pseudo-code. It helped reinforce key concepts like modular design, separation of concerns, and collaborative coding practices. In terms of Git and GitHub, the collaborative aspect taught me how important it is to follow consistent workflows—like branching strategies, writing clear commit messages, and managing pull requests. I also appreciated the exposure to resolving merge conflicts and reviewing code changes, which are critical skills in real-world development.
